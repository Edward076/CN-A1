    "\n",
    "The key findings are summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Error Convergence Behavior:\n",
    "*   The equally spaced quadrature method exhibits slow and erratic convergence, with significant numerical errors for small and moderate values of ð. This is likely due to Rungeâs phenomenon, where polynomial interpolation using equally spaced points leads to large oscillations near the interval endpoints.\n",
    "*   The Chebyshev quadrature method demonstrates much better convergence. The error decreases consistently as ð increases, showing that Chebyshev points effectively mitigate numerical instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Impact of Quadrature Point Selection:\n",
    "*  The equally spaced rule struggles because high-degree polynomial interpolation at these points amplifies errors, especially at larger\n",
    "ð.\n",
    "*   The Chebyshev rule places more points near the endpoints, reducing oscillations and improving approximation accuracy, which aligns with the theoretical benefits of Chebyshev interpolation in numerical integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Graphical Analysis:\n",
    "*   The logarithmic error plot clearly illustrates that Chebyshev quadrature achieves exponential error reduction, while the equally spaced method has irregular behavior and does not improve as rapidly.\n",
    "*   Even for small ð, the Chebyshev quadrature already provides significantly lower errors compared to equally spaced quadrature.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Conclusion\n",
    "The Chebyshev quadrature method is superior in terms of accuracy and stability. Equally spaced quadrature points, though straightforward, suffer from interpolation issues leading to large errors. This study reinforces that for numerical integration using interpolatory quadrature rules, choosing well-distributed points, such as Chebyshev nodes, is critical for high accuracy and efficiency."
